# Server Setup

Coming soon.

# The Mods

These lists are structured alphabetically with any notable information for each mod attached to them in addition to its link. Furthermore, multiple lists were created for both purely client-side and purely server-side mods in addition to the full modlist. Any mod only present in the full modlist is required on both client and server to function. 

Lastly, while some server-side mods can also be installed on the client for the same effect, the server-side mods will be treated as either an online server or a singleplayer (localhost) "server" for the sake of comprehensiveness within the following lists.

If possible, the following links will lead to the mods respective Modrinth page. If a Modrinth page does not exist, or is not up to date, the link will lead to Curseforge or any other site the mod is primarily hosted on.

> Content mods are here defined as any mod that adds an item, mob, or special mechanic to the game. These mods are required for the full experience of this modpack and must be installed on both client and server to function. This list is here to act, not only as just a list of each mod, but as a resource to access each mods wiki and any additional information needed to understand and grasp the extent of each mod.
